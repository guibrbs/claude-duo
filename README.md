# Claude Duo

[![Security regression](https://github.com/guibrbs/claude-duo/actions/workflows/security-regression.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/guibrbs/claude-duo/actions/workflows/security-regression.yml)

**Two Claude Desktop accounts on one Mac, side by side.** Keep the official
**Claude** app signed in to one account and run **Claude Duo**, a managed copy,
signed in to another: personal and work, two organizations, or two plans. Each
app has its own account, its own Claude Code profile and its own Keychain item,
and both can be open at the same time.

> ⚠️ **Experimental and unofficial.** This is an independent project, not
> affiliated with or endorsed by Anthropic. Claude Duo is a copy of the official
> app that is **signed locally**, without Anthropic's signature. Some scenarios
> are still being validated (see [Limitations](#limitations)). Use it at your own
> risk and follow the terms of use of each account and your organization's rules.

## Why

Claude Desktop holds one account at a time. Switching means signing out and in,
losing your place in Chat, Cowork and Code. Simply duplicating the app is not
enough either: the copy reuses the original's encrypted storage and asks for
your login Keychain password, and claude.ai treats a renamed copy as a web
browser. Claude Duo handles those details and keeps the copy up to date.

## Quick start

Requirements: macOS 12 or later, the official Claude in `/Applications`, and the
Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/guibrbs/claude-duo.git ~/claude-duo
```

```bash
~/claude-duo/duo/install-duo.sh
```

The installer:

1. checks the requirements;
2. installs the versioned toolset (content-verified);
3. writes the config to `~/.config/claude-instances/claude-duo.conf`;
4. adds the **Update Claude Duo** app to `~/Applications`;
5. adds an hourly check that offers to update the Duo after Claude updates
   (skip it with `--no-auto-check`);
6. builds the Duo. It **asks before quitting Claude**, because building needs
   both apps closed, and reopens Claude at the end. When the installer runs
   inside Claude (in the Code tab, for example), it does not build right away,
   because that would end its own session: it opens **Update Claude Duo**,
   which builds outside Claude.

Then open **~/Applications/Claude Duo** and sign in with your second account.

## Everyday use

- **Open:** `Claude Duo` from the Dock, Launchpad or Spotlight. The original is
  still your usual `Claude`.
- **Update:** when the official Claude updates, a prompt asks *"Update now?"*.
  You can also open **Update Claude Duo** at any time. Either way, both apps
  quit, the Duo is rebuilt and verified, and whatever was open reopens.
  Prompts and notifications follow your macOS language (English or Portuguese).
- **Previous versions:** every update keeps the previous Duo in
  `~/Applications/.claude-txn.*` and nothing prunes them, so they take up disk
  space (up to the size of the app each). To inspect one, use the identifier
  the log shows:
  `CLAUDE_INSTANCES_CONF=~/.config/claude-instances/claude-duo.conf ~/.local/share/claude-instances/toolsets/dispatcher run claude-apps-refresh.sh --recover .claude-txn.XXXXXXXX`.
- **Connectors (Google Drive, Slack…):** connect them in a private browser
  window signed in to the Duo's account (claude.ai → Settings → Connectors),
  then press ⌘R in the Duo. Connector sign-in started inside the Duo does not
  come back to it, because `claude://` links belong to the official app.
- **Same instructions, memories and skills in Code (optional):** with the Duo
  closed, run the command below. It links the Duo's `CLAUDE.md`, skills, output
  styles, tools, plugins and per-project memories to the original's, and copies
  `settings.json` once. Sign-in, sessions and history stay separate. Install
  plugins from the original. Add `--mcp-servers` to also copy your user-scope
  MCP servers, credentials included; a server the Duo already has is kept.
  Details in [docs/PROFILE_REUSE.md](docs/PROFILE_REUSE.md).

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 -I ~/claude-duo/scripts/share-code-profile.py --apply --backup-existing
```

## Claude Code in the terminal for the Duo's account (loop-duo, duo-send)

The Duo app and the `claude` command keep separate sign-ins: a Duo that works
in its window still has a command line that never signed in. loop-duo and
duo-send run `claude` on the Duo's account, so sign it in once, in a Terminal
outside any Claude session, with the Duo's account:

```bash
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-duo claude auth login
```

`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-duo claude auth status` shows which account it
is. The original's sign-in (`~/.claude`) is not touched. Both scripts check
this before they start and print this command when it is missing.

## loop-duo: one account develops, the other reviews (optional)

With both Code accounts on this Mac, one can develop and the other review in
the same repository, round after round, until the reviewer approves:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 -I ~/claude-duo/duo/loop-duo.py run "goal" --repo ~/path/to/repo
```

- **Roles:** by default the original account develops and the Duo's reviews.
  To swap them, use `--dev duo --reviewer original`.
- **Branch:** the work goes to a `loop-duo/<goal>-<id>` branch, created from
  HEAD in a worktree of its own. The reviewer runs without the edit tools,
  and a reviewer turn that changes the branch anyway does not count. Untracked
  files are never committed: they go back to the developer.
- **Questions:** one agent's question goes to the other, because `claude -p`
  has no way to ask the user.
- **Ceilings:** `--rounds` (6) and `--max-cost` (estimated US$). Every round
  uses both accounts' usage.
- **PR:** `--until pr` pushes and opens a draft PR after approval. Merging
  stays with you.
- **Follow along:** `loop-duo.py list` shows the loops. The conversation
  between the agents is in `~/.local/share/claude-duo/loops/<id>/conversation.md`.

Details and limits: [docs/LOOP_DUO.md](docs/LOOP_DUO.md).

## duo-send: hand a task to the Duo's account (optional)

The original Claude Code, or you in a terminal, can give a task to the Duo's
account, in a repository you name:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 -I ~/claude-duo/duo/duo-send.py send "task" --repo ~/path/to/repo
/usr/bin/python3 -I ~/claude-duo/duo/duo-send.py send "task" --repo ~/path/to/repo --bg
```

- **Synchronous (default):** `claude -p` on the Duo's account; prints the
  answer when the work is done. `--max-cost` caps the spending, `--json`
  returns the answer, session and cost, `--resume` continues a session.
- **`--bg`:** a background session on the Duo's account; returns its id at
  once. `duo-send.py agents`, `logs <id>`, `attach <id>` and `stop <id>` reach
  the Duo's sessions, which the original's `claude agents` does not list.
- **Duo inbox:** a session in the Duo window that runs `/duo-inbox`, takes
  tasks the original Claude sends, does them where you can watch, and reports
  back. `duo-send.py inbox --open --repo …` opens one (press Enter there).
  Details in [docs/DUO_INBOX.md](docs/DUO_INBOX.md).
- **Talk to a session open in the Duo window:** `duo-send.py sessions` lists
  the Duo's open sessions with their `uds:/tmp/cc-socks/<pid>.sock` address;
  the original Claude's `SendMessage` to that address reaches the session, and
  the reply comes back.
- **Same isolation as loop-duo:** the Duo's account, environment and
  `claude -p` turn come from `loop-duo.py`. `bypassPermissions` is refused.
- **From the original Claude:** `install-duo.sh` installs the script in
  `~/.local/share/claude-duo`, the `duo-send` skill in `~/.claude/skills` and
  the `duo-inbox` skill in the Duo's Code folder, so you can just ask the
  original Claude to send work to the Duo. It never replaces a skill of your
  own with the same name; `--no-skill` skips them, and `uninstall-duo.sh`
  removes them.

- **On the Duo's screen:** after `duo/install-duo.sh --links` (it adds
  `@links claude-dev` to the config and rebuilds), `duo-send.py open --repo … --prompt "…"`
  opens a new Code session in the Duo window, and `send … --open` imports the
  finished session there. Details in
  [docs/DUO_VISIBLE_SESSION.md](docs/DUO_VISIBLE_SESSION.md).

Details: [docs/DUO_SEND.md](docs/DUO_SEND.md).

## How it works

- The Duo is a copy of the official `Claude.app` in `~/Applications` with its
  own bundle identifier, its own Desktop profile
  (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude-Duo`) and its own Code profile
  (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-duo`).
- **Its own Keychain item:** Electron names its encryption key
  `<productName> Safe Storage`. The builder changes only `productName` inside
  `app.asar` to `Duo Claude`, without changing the file size, and reseals the
  archive hashes. The Duo therefore never asks for the original's
  `Claude Safe Storage`. The name is `Duo Claude` rather than `Claude Duo`
  because the user agent drops spaces (`DuoClaude/…`) and claude.ai only enables
  the desktop UI for a `claude/` token.
- **Checks:** the source must carry Anthropic's signature and pass Gatekeeper.
  The integrity record **regenerates the expected result from the source** and
  requires byte-for-byte equality; any other difference is refused. Publishing
  is atomic and keeps the previous version for inspection.
- Details: [HARDENING.md](HARDENING.md), [docs/APP_INTEGRITY.md](docs/APP_INTEGRITY.md),
  [docs/KEYCHAIN_NAMESPACE_EXPERIMENTS.md](docs/KEYCHAIN_NAMESPACE_EXPERIMENTS.md)
  and [docs/TOOLSET_INSTALLATION.md](docs/TOOLSET_INSTALLATION.md).

## Limitations

- Local signature: the Duo loses Anthropic's identity, and macOS asks again for
  permissions such as folders, microphone or automation.
- It must be rebuilt after every official Claude update; don't use the Duo's
  own built-in updater.
- Still being validated: the effective Code account in each app, signing out of
  one account without affecting the other, and both apps open for long periods
  ([validation plan](docs/GUI_VALIDATION.md), [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md)).
- It does not protect against malicious software running as your user; the
  local records detect changes but are not a security boundary.

## Uninstall

Quit Claude Duo and run:

```bash
~/claude-duo/duo/uninstall-duo.sh
```

The script shows the list and asks for confirmation. It then turns off the
update check and moves everything into one folder in the Trash, deleting
nothing:

- `~/Applications/Claude Duo.app` and `~/Applications/Update Claude Duo.app`
  (and the earlier `Atualizar Claude Duo.app`, if it is still there);
- the update check, in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.github.guibrbs.claude-duo.update-check.plist`;
- the Duo tools, in `~/.local/share/claude-duo`, and the config, in
  `~/.config/claude-instances/claude-duo.conf`;
- the logs, in `~/Library/Logs/Claude Duo Updater`;
- the toolset, in `~/.local/share/claude-instances`, and the previous
  versions, in `~/Applications/.claude-txn.*`. These two stay while another
  config in `~/.config/claude-instances` still uses them.

The Duo account's data stays unless you run it with `--include-account-data`.
That moves the Desktop and Code profiles the config's Duo line names, by default
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude-Duo` and `~/.claude-duo`. It never moves
a folder outside the profile locations the toolset accepts for the Duo, such as
the original's. If you
used Code sharing, the shared items inside `~/.claude-duo` are links: moving
them does not affect the originals in `~/.claude`. The `Duo Claude Safe
Storage` item stays in the Keychain; delete it in Keychain Access if you want.

## Development

```bash
python3 scripts/run-security-tests.py all
```

Tests run only in temporary folders with synthetic apps and accounts. CI runs
the same suite on arm64 and x86_64, plus the Clang static analyzer.
